# Virulent

Virulent is a turn-based tactical game where you are in charge of managing a global viral outbreak, and if you are lucky, save the world.

I dedicate this game to every person who has been separated from their family or loved ones during the tragic corona virus outbreak of 2020. We miss you dearly.

# History

Virulent is a remake of an Atari game called "Epidemic!" by Steven Faber (1982).

I started the project in July 2020 for the [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) fantasy console. It took 4 weekends to complete. I referenced the [original game manual](http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-epidemic_1859.html) to derive the game mechanics. I updated the world data to reflect modern country names and statistics, and added three new countries - Madagascar, Southeast Asia and South Africa.

If you would like to play the original game by Steven Faber, you can find the Atari version from [myabandonware.com](https://www.myabandonware.com/game/epidemic-26#Atari%208-bit) and use an emulator like [atari800](https://atari800.github.io). The DOS version is not playable, in my opinion.
